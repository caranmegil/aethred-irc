ares -> #lobby: using irssi
caranmegil -> #lobby: interesting choice of name
ares -> #lobby: hi aethred!
ares -> #lobby: how are you today?
caranmegil -> #lobby: so that's broken.  he is supposed to only respond if his name is said at the beginning
caranmegil -> #lobby: aethred: burp
ares -> #lobby: oh
ares -> #lobby: his personality sounds like it comes from Ash quotes :D
caranmegil -> #lobby: aethred: pity
caranmegil -> #lobby: that too
ares -> #lobby: aethred: joker
caranmegil -> #lobby: he used to do context switching.  like i'd build personalities that would be triggered based on chat messages
ares -> #lobby: aethred: easter
ares -> #lobby: aethred: christmas
caranmegil -> #lobby: aethred: splork
caranmegil -> #lobby: aethred: splork
caranmegil -> #lobby: aethred: splork
caranmegil -> #lobby: and that is the brokenness of the random sentence generator.  it's because i preload but the node will send a response before the preload is finished
ares -> #lobby: yeah this is the nick I used to run with, that and war_god
ares -> #lobby: bryan's was cybmage
caranmegil -> #lobby: couldn't remember all of them.  i knew ares was in the mix
ares -> #lobby: not sure if it'd be cool or creepy to have a bot with his nick saying things he would say xD
caranmegil -> #lobby: man, that'd make me sad
caranmegil -> #lobby: exactly, aethred.  exactly
ares -> #lobby: aye
caranmegil -> #lobby: the good news is that i could build different personalities quite easily.  maybe i'll do one that is called communist_bot which will spout random phrases from the communist manifesto
_ares_ -> #lobby: lol
_ares_ -> #lobby: random mao quotes
caranmegil -> #lobby: and mix in "chenese proverb" which are just product slogans made to sound philosophical
caranmegil -> #lobby: one such example is "one is not fully clean unless they are zestfully clean."
caranmegil -> #lobby: ah.  i found out some piece that i coded and forgot about.  it also explains why the bot randomly sometimes responds.  it has a .2 probability of responding to channel messages

ares -> #lobby: lol that's pretty cool, I'm guessing he was a little too chatty at some point :D
ares -> #lobby: at black hat this year there was a talk about 18 ways to spoof emails, which included those super safe certificate signed emails...we have a business unit trying to strong arm a dev team into writing some code which performs action again emails received and they keep trying to push it through architecture review for approval without having to discuss the concerns around what stupid ass crap they're trying to
ares -> #lobby: pull
caranmegil -> #lobby: yes the bot was in yahoo! chat speaking just about every sentence annoying people to no end.  i remember i built a system for this guy to remotely shutdown his computer from his blackberry
caranmegil -> #lobby: yeah, it was fancy pants, aethred.  but anyhow he wanted a cert
caranmegil -> #lobby: in the e-mail and wanted all kinds of things.  i said an app was better but he didn't want an app
